[`cheat`](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) is a useful tool to note for shell commands. 

> cheat allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line. It was designed to help remind *nix system administrators of options for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.

Strongly recommand to try this tool.

And here are all my cheat files.
